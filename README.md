# Ship-classification-usingCNN
Ship classification plays a crucial role in various 
applications, including maritime security and vessel traffic 
monitoring. In this research paper, we are presenting a 
convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for the 
classification of five categories of ships, where the dataset used 
is obtained from Kaggle which contains images and the 
Category for each image. To enhance the robustness and the 
quality of the model, an augmentation technique is employed as 
one of the preprocessing techniques for the images. Also, the 
images are resized to increase the quality of the dataset. The 
dataset is then split into 72% training, 18% validation, and 10% 
for testing. The model was built using Python TensorFlow and 
Keras libraries and the architecture contains convolutional and 
pooling layers, a flattening layer, a dense layer, and an output 
layer. The model achieved strong performance metrics with a 
weighted average of 92% in all F1 scores, precision, and recall. 
Furthermore, the training, validation, and testing accuracies of 
97.15%, 91.75%, and 91.85%, respectively, showcase its efficacy 
for ship classification in diverse maritime applications.
